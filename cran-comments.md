## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added more examples to `picosat_sat`
* Explained SAT problems in the description file
* Added a reference to one of the papers describing PicoSAT in `picosat_sat`. I could not find a paper with a DOI and also could not find any further information about the requested "authors (year) <DOI:...>" syntax. That is why I added the reference to the `picosat_sat` function.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
